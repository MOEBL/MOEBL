  My Online eBook Library (MOEBL)
===================================

MOEBL enables you to create your own online OPDS/HTML eBook Library.
Using calibres metadata.db, format, & cover files along with your eBook files you can
create a library/catalog to download your eBooks to any device that has the facility
to read the downloaded eBook format (eg. epub, PDF, mobi, etc...).


 Requirements.
---------------
+ A web server with PHP 5.3 or 5.4 with GD image processing & SQLite3 support.
+ Calibre library/database files (metadata.db, format, & cover files).
+ eBook files.


 Installation.
---------------
+ Extract the zip file to a folder on your web server.
+ Make a copy of the file config_default.php and rename the copy to config.php
+ Edit config.php with your own settings.

If your Calibre database is inside your web directory then there is no need for you to
set an internal location in the config.php file.


 Notes on OpenSearch.
----------------------
OpenSearch allows searching through an OPDS catalog. This works with FBReader and
Mantano Reader for Android based devices but it seems that Aldiko didn't implement it
correctly so it won't work with Aldiko.


 URL rewriting.
----------------
 + Apache.
   Put the following in the .htaccess file located where you extracted MOEBL:
        RewriteEngine on
        RewriteOptions inherit
        RewriteRule ^download/(.*)/.*\.(.*)$ fetch.php?data=$1&type=$2 [L]
        
    If you don't have mod_xsendfile, then in the config file set;
        $config['moebl_x_accel_redirect'] = "location"; 
 
 + Nginx.
    location /download/ {
      rewrite ^/download/(\d+)/.*\.(.*)$ /fetch.php?data=$1&type=$2 last;
      break;
    }
    
 + Cherokee.
   + Add a Behavior of type Regular Expression: /moebl/download/(.*)/.*\.(.*)$
   + Choose the handler Redirection
   + Add the substitution regexp: "/moebl/download/(.*)/.*\.(.*)$" --> "/moebl/fetch.php?data=$1&type=$2"


 Known Problems.
-----------------
 + So far MOEBL works with with Apache based web servers (may work with others, please let me know).
 + This is only early stages of this script so they maybe other issues, which will be sorted out eventually.


 Disclaimer.

By continuing to use this software and its code you acknowledge this disclaimer section of this README file
in its entirety.

I have only tested this myself on Apache based web servers, it may work on others but either way I can in
no way be held responsible for any loss of data or damages that may be or may have been caused by the use
if this software and its code. YOU USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

On the OPDS client side MOEBLS has been tested with FBReader and Aldiko on Android based devices, and with
Stanza on iOS based devices.
